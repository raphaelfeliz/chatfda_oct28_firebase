# **LOG — Resolving Widget CORS & Grey Square Issues**

## **Phase 2.0 — Initial CORS Encounter & Fix (Assets)**

### **Objective**
Resolve cross-origin request (CORS) issues preventing the widget's static assets (JS, CSS) from loading correctly in external pages, specifically from a local `test.html` file.

---

### **0010 LOG – Initial CORS Diagnosis (JS Asset)**
**Purpose:** Understand why the widget's JavaScript was failing to load from `test.html`.

**Actions:**
1.  User reported `Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 ()` for `index-0jFUGsFw.js` when opening `test.html`.
2.  Inspected `dist/assets` directory after `npm run build` and identified new asset names (e.g., `index-DQZCzI35.js`).
3.  Updated `test.html` to reference the new, correct asset filenames.
4.  Despite updating `test.html`, the `404` error for the JavaScript file persisted.
5.  Used `curl -I https://gen-lang-client-0545699517.web.app/assets/index-DQZCzI35.js` to directly check the server. This confirmed a `404 Not Found` response, indicating the newly built files were not yet deployed.
6.  Deployed new build: `firebase deploy --only hosting`.

**Diagnosis:**
The `404` was due to a mismatch between locally built asset names and those deployed on Firebase Hosting. Redeploying the new build was necessary.

**Result:**
✅ Assets successfully deployed. `curl` against `index-DQZCzI35.js` now returned a `200 OK`.

---

### **0011 LOG – CORS Asset Block Revisited**
**Purpose:** Diagnose persistent widget failure (no widget visible, despite 200 OK on JS asset) when loading `test.html`.

**Actions:**
1.  After `0010 LOG`'s successful deployment, `test.html` still failed to load the widget.
2.  Browser console showed `Access to script at 'https://gen-lang-client-0545699517.web.app/assets/index-DQZCzI35.js' from origin 'http://127.0.0.1:5501' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.`
3.  `curl -I https://gen-lang-client-0545699517.web.app/assets/index-DQZCzI35.js` was run, and the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header was *missing* from the response. This confirmed the server was not sending the required CORS permission.
4.  Inspected `firebase.json` for headers configuration. It was initially too restrictive or missing the correct source glob for assets.
5.  Updated `firebase.json` with a broad `source: "**"` rule for `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`.
6.  Deployed `firebase deploy --only hosting`.
7.  Re-verified with `curl`. The header was *still missing*. This indicated a potential issue with CDN caching or how `firebase.json` rules interact with `rewrites`.

**Diagnosis:**
The fundamental CORS header (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`) was missing from Firebase Hosting's responses for static assets. Repeated deployments didn't immediately fix it, suggesting deeper configuration interaction or caching.

**Next Step:** Implement a more precise and diagnostic `firebase.json` configuration, and test specific files to isolate the failure point.

---

### **0012 LOG – Precise CORS Diagnostic & Fix (Assets)**
**Purpose:** Systematically diagnose and resolve the persistent CORS header issue on Firebase Hosting assets.

**Actions:**
1.  Created a diagnostic file `dist/_probe.txt` to test specific header rules.
2.  Updated `firebase.json` with highly specific header rules and strict order of directives (`public`, `ignore`, `headers`, `rewrites`):
    *   One rule for `_probe.txt` including `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` and `Cache-Control: no-store`.
    *   Another rule for `**/*.@(js|css|map|svg)` including `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`.
3.  Deployed with debug logging: `firebase deploy --only hosting --debug`. Deployment logs confirmed the new header configuration was included in the version manifest.
4.  **Verified `_probe.txt`:** `curl -I https://gen-lang-client-0545699517.web.app/_probe.txt` successfully returned `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` and `Cache-Control: no-store`. This proved Firebase Hosting *could* apply custom headers and that our deployment was working.
5.  **Verified JS asset:** `curl -I https://gen-lang-client-0545699517.web.app/assets/index-DQZCzI35.js` successfully returned `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`.

**Diagnosis:**
The problem was traced to an interaction or precedence issue with overly broad `source` globs in `firebase.json` conflicting with `rewrites`. By making the header rules more specific, the configuration was correctly applied.

**Result:**
✅ CORS headers for static assets (`.js`, `.css`, `.svg`, `.map`) are now correctly applied by Firebase Hosting.

## **Phase 2.1 — Widget Styling & Icon Fix ("Grey Square")**

### **Objective**
Resolve the issue where the widget launcher appears as an unstyled "grey square".

---

### **0013 LOG – Grey Square Diagnosis & Fix**
**Purpose:** Identify why the launcher icon was not rendering correctly after CORS assets were resolved.

**Actions:**
1.  User observed the widget launcher as a "grey square" despite JS/CSS assets loading without CORS errors.
2.  Console logs confirmed the widget's JavaScript (`index-DQZCzI35.js`) was trying to load CSS (`index-DN-9DjmB.css`) into the Shadow DOM. This specific CSS filename was from an *old build*.
3.  Realized the icon itself was likely an SVG asset not covered by the previous `**/*.@(js|css|map)` CORS rule.
4.  Cleaned the `dist` directory: `rm -rf dist`.
5.  Rebuilt the project: `npm run build`. This generated new assets with current filenames.
6.  Updated `firebase.json` to include `svg` in the CORS header rule (`**/*.@(js|css|map|svg)`).
7.  Deployed the new build and configuration: `firebase deploy --only hosting`.
8.  Verified `curl -I https://gen-lang-client-0545699517.web.app/assets/index-DEj2Eleg.css` showed `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` (confirming the CSS rule was applied).
9.  Updated `test.html` to point to the latest built asset names (matching the CSS and JS generated by the latest build).

**Diagnosis:**
The "grey square" was due to two issues:
1.  **CSS Mismatch:** The JavaScript was attempting to load an outdated CSS file into the Shadow DOM, resulting in no styling.
2.  **SVG CORS (Initial Hypothesis):** Although the `curl` didn't explicitly show an SVG error (due to inline CSS), the broader CORS rule for `svg` files ensures that if any external SVG assets were needed, they would load correctly. The primary fix was ensuring the CSS loaded correctly.

**Result:**
✅ The widget launcher now renders correctly with its icon and styles. The combined effect of a fresh build/deploy and correctly configured CORS for all necessary asset types resolved the issue.
