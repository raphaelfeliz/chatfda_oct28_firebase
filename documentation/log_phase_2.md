# **Phase 2 — CORS & Cross-Origin Validation**

### **Objective**
Resolve cross-origin request (CORS) issues preventing the widget from loading in external pages and verify full cross-origin functionality.

---

## **0012 LOG – CORS Error Diagnosis**
**Purpose:** Test deployed widget and identify cause of failure when loaded from a local test page.

**Actions**
1. User opened `test.html` locally and attempted to load the deployed widget.  
2. Verified the deployment via `curl` — confirmed assets served correctly from Firebase Hosting.  
3. Observed console error:  


No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.

`

**Diagnosis:**  
CORS policy blocking local file (`origin: null`) from requesting Firebase-hosted script. Firebase config missing CORS headers.

**Next Step:**  
Modify `firebase.json` to add CORS headers and redeploy.

---

## **0013 LOG – Fix CORS Issue**
**Purpose:** Add proper CORS headers to Firebase Hosting configuration.

**Actions**
1. Inspected `firebase.json` → confirmed no `"headers"` section.  
2. Added:
json
"headers": [
  {
    "source": "**",
    "headers": [
      { "key": "Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "value": "*" }
    ]
  }
]
`

3. User deployed updated configuration (`firebase deploy --only hosting`).
4. Verified headers via `curl` → `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` present.
5. Retested locally — widget now loads and renders successfully.

**Result:**
✅ CORS fully resolved. The widget now loads correctly when embedded in a local or third-party page.

---

### **Notes**

* **Success:** Firebase Hosting now serves assets with correct `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header.
* **New Issue Identified:**
  Browser console warning —

  
  DEBUG: VITE_WIDGET_API_KEY loaded as: undefined
  

  Indicates environment variables not loaded in the deployed environment.
  This will be addressed in the next phase.

### **Phase 2 Summary**

| Goal                         | Status | Key Fix                                    |
| ---------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| Identify CORS failure        | ✅      | Local load blocked by missing CORS header  |
| Fix Firebase Hosting headers | ✅      | Added `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`     |
| Verify cross-origin load     | ✅      | Widget loads successfully in `test.html`   |
| Detect new issue (env vars)  | ⚠️     | API key undefined — to be fixed in Phase 3 |
