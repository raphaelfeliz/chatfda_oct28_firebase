# PHASE 3: GITHUB
- A brief summary of the phase's goal and expected outcome.

## 3.1 GOAL: Initialize Git and Push Project to a Remote Repository
- summary: This phase will establish source control for the project. We will initialize a new Git repository, create a `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files, make an initial commit, and then push the entire project to a remote GitHub repository to ensure its safety and track future changes.

### 3.1.1 STEP: Verify Git Status
- summary: I will run `git status` to check if a Git repository is already initialized in the project directory. This ensures we start from a clean state.

### 3.1.2 STEP: Initialize Git Repository
- summary: If no repository is found, I will run `git init` to create a new, empty Git repository in the project's root directory.

### 3.1.3 STEP: Create and Configure `.gitignore`
- summary: I will create a `.gitignore` file in the root directory. This file will be populated with rules to exclude build artifacts (`/dist`), local dependencies (`/node_modules`), and secret files (`.env*`) from being committed to the repository.

### 3.1.4 STEP: Make Initial Commit
- summary: I will stage all relevant project files and create the first commit with a descriptive message, establishing the initial baseline for the project's history.

### 3.1.5 STEP: Connect to Remote and Push
- summary: After you provide the remote repository URL, I will link the local repository to it and push the `main` branch to GitHub, making the project's code available on the remote server.
